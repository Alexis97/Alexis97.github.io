<!-- ### About Me -->
I'm a second year CSE Ph.D. student at [the Pennsylvania State University](https://www.eecs.psu.edu/) working in [Lab for Perception, Action and Cognition (LPAC)](http://vision.cse.psu.edu) under [Dr. Yanxi Liu](https://www.cse.psu.edu/~yul11/) and [Dr. Robert Collins](https://www.cse.psu.edu/~rtc12/). My primary research interests are: computational similarity based on human perception, recurring pattern discovery, and self-supervised learning. 

### My Background
Before coming Penn State, I obtained my B.S. in CSE at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/) working in [Center for Brain-like Computing and Machine Intelligence (BCMI)](https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/) under [Dr. Liqing Zhang](https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/~zhangliqing/). During that period of time, I also had an internship at [Shanghai Versa](https://www.versa-ai.com/) where I learnt a lot about transfer learning and GAN-like models.

### What's New
I'm currently working on Recurring Pattern research to demonstrate the utility of recurring pattern discovery from a single image for spatial understanding of a 3D scene. 
I've developed a tool for crowd-sourcing recurring pattern labels using Amazon Mechanical Turk.
